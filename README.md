# DEMOCRACY Client

A mobile application that brings the German Bundestag to citizens' smartphones, allowing them to vote on parliamentary procedures and compare their choices with official results.

## Features

- Browse and search official German Bundestag procedures
- Vote on procedures as if you were a member of parliament
- Compare your voting behavior with the community and the Bundestag
- Analyze your agreement with different parties and candidates
- Receive notifications about important parliamentary activities

## Technology Stack

- React Native with Expo Router
- Apollo GraphQL client
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Recoil and Zustand for state management
- E2E testing with Maestro
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn package manager (v1.22.19+)
- iOS development environment (for iOS)
  - Xcode
  - CocoaPods
- Android development environment (for Android)
  - Android Studio
  - Android SDK

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/democracy-deutschland/democracy-client.git
   cd democracy-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Generate GraphQL types:

   ```bash
   yarn codegen
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

5. Run on specific platforms:
   ```bash
   yarn ios     # Run on iOS simulator
   yarn android # Run on Android emulator
   ```

## Development

- Run type checking: `yarn lint:ts`
- Run linter: `yarn lint`
- Run doctor for Expo issues: `yarn doctor`

### Dependency Resolutions (ANSI Tooling)

We pin `wrap-ansi@7.0.0`, `string-width@4.2.3`, and `strip-ansi@6.0.1` to avoid a CommonJS/ESM interop runtime error ("TypeError: stringWidth is not a function") triggered in the Expo CLI table renderer when a newer ESM-only `string-width` version is hoisted. Details and an upgrade checklist live in [`docs/DEPENDENCY-RESOLUTIONS.md`](./docs/DEPENDENCY-RESOLUTIONS.md).

## Testing

The project uses Maestro for end-to-end testing. See [Testing Documentation](./docs/TESTING.md) for more information.

Run tests locally with:

```bash
yarn test:e2e          # Run all E2E tests
yarn test:e2e:smoke    # Run smoke tests only
yarn test:e2e:verification  # Run verification flow tests only
```

### Manual E2E Testing on GitHub Actions

E2E tests can be manually triggered on any branch through GitHub Actions:
1. Go to **Actions** â†’ **ðŸ§ª E2E Tests** workflow
2. Click **Run workflow** and select test type and platform
3. Tests will run on the selected branch

This is useful for testing feature branches before merging.
